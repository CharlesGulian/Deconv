# Deconvolution Project Script Tutorial:

This tutorial demonstrates the functions of the following scripts in this repository:

- MainCompare.py
- sex_stats.py
- sex_config.py
- fits_tools.py
- pysex.py

### MainCompare.py

* This is the "main comparison" script, i.e. where the actual image comparisons get done, and where the resulting data is collected and analyzed
* It should be run at the command line using ```python MainCompare.py```
* This script makes use of all of the other scripts listed in this tutorial either directly or indirectly; as such, most demonstrations of other scripts will pertain to MainCompare.py
